## `Plots_llss_coshFit`
Plots for all channels showing the effective mass and sliding window
fit. 

## `Plots_mass_tdepen`
Plots for all channels showing the estimate on the mass extracted
through a sliding window procedure as a function of the temperature.

## `Plots_corr_norm`
Plots of the correlation function for all channels and flavour
structures. Each plots shows the correlation function for all
available temperatures.
